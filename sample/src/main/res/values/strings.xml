        Heterogeneous Adapter is an extension of RecyclerView Adapter intended to make creating
        lists with different types of items more straightforward. To accomplish this, Heterogeneous
        Adapter uses Sections to divide items into groups of the same type. Sections behave just
        like a separate RecyclerView Adapter, with the condition that they can only have one type of
        item view. Once attached to a Heterogeneous Adapter, Sections display one after another in
        the order they were added (or the specified order if set manually).

        \n\nThis abstraction allows many behaviors that would normally be tedious and generate
        significant amounts of unreadable boilerplate code to be implemented with minimal effort.
        For example, the  “Dynamic Entries” header below is only visible when its corresponding
        Section has content.

        \n\nAnother feature not shown here is that Heterogeneous Adapter includes an Empty State
        implementation that can be added just as easily as it is to create a new Section.
